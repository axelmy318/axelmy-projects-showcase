# axelmy-projects-showcase ðŸ‘‹

A ReactJS website to showcase most of the development projects I made along the way


## Why ? ðŸ¤”

I needed a way to document my node packages, so that users would have access to code examples and documentation.

By expanding the scope of the project, it now also serves as my portfolio.
